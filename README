my first go-module: hello, world

install w/:
goinstall github.com/JayTeeSF/Helloer

from your code you can:
  include Hey "github.com/JayTeeSF/Helloer"

which gives you the string returning method:
   Hey.SayHello()

See hello_world.go for an example:
   6g hello_world.go
   6l hello_world.6
   ./6.out

ls -al $GOROOT/pkg/*/github.com/JayTeeSF/

# if you download the repo from github, then test it by RUNNING:
make test
