my first go-module: hello, world

install w/:
goinstall github.com/JayTeeSF/Helloer

from your code you can:
  include "helloer"

which gives you the string returning method:
   helloer.SayHello()

ls -al $GOROOT/pkg/*/github.com/JayTeeSF/

# if you download the repo from github, then test it by RUNNING:
make test
